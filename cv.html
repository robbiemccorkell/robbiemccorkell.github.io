				<h3>Interests</h3>
				<hr>
				<p>I am a great fan of all things digital. After teaching myself HTML and CSS at 13 in my spare time, I also designed and built a home theatre PC in my mid-teens for my family to store pictures, music and video, and record live television. I subsequently revised my design to make it smaller, faster and quieter. Today I focus more on programming, my primary interest being in mobile application development for Android, iOS and Windows Phone.</p>
				
				<p>I am also a keen runner and musician. I take part in competitive 10K races, and have completed a half-marathon. I also play guitar and lead a band whilst in Exeter, playing in pubs and clubs around the city.</p>
