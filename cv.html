					<li>Refactored and cleaned a top-level internal application for managing a large database. Added features to detect which user was last logged in to the system from a machine, and the ability to save a 'favourite artist' for each user for quick access when testing the system.</li>
					<li>Developed an application using C# and WPF to manage a large Microsoft SQL Server database of images using LINQ to SQL. Users gained the ability to view, edit and export images in the database along with their related data.</li>
					<li>Developed tools to identify similar images in the database using open source versions of perceptual hash, and SURF libraries. Also developed tools for identifying CD or Vinyl images using AForge.NET image processing libraries.</li>

				<h3>Interests</h3>
				<hr>
				<p>I am a self-confessed and proud geek. When I'm not at my computer you can find me exploring live music venues and cocktail bars in London with my friends. I am also a keen runner and musician. I take part in competitive 10K races, and have completed a half-marathon. I also play guitar and lead a band whilst in Exeter, playing in pubs and clubs around the city. I'm very interested in personal fitness, so I go to the gym regularly, and occasionally go cycling. One of these days I'll be brave enough to take up climbing.</p>
